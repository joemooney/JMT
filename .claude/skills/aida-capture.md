# AIDA Session Capture Skill

## Purpose

Review the current conversation and capture any requirements, features, or implementation details that were discussed but not yet added to the requirements database.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User says "capture requirements" or "review session"
- At the end of a conversational coding session
- User asks to update requirements based on what was discussed
- After implementing features without explicitly creating requirements

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan Conversation

Review the conversation history for:
- Features that were discussed or requested
- Bugs that were identified or fixed
- Implementation decisions that were made
- Ideas or future enhancements mentioned
- Any work that was completed

### Step 2: Check Against Database

For each finding, check if it already exists:

```bash
aida list --search "<keyword>"
```

### Step 3: Present Findings

Present a summary to the user:
```
## Session Review

### Implemented (not in database)
- [Description of implemented work]

### Discussed (not captured)
- [Description of discussed feature/idea]

### Existing Requirements Updated
- [SPEC-ID] - Status changed / notes added
```

### Step 4: Offer Actions

For each finding, offer to:
1. **Add as new requirement**: Create with appropriate type and status
2. **Update existing**: Add comments or change status
3. **Skip**: Don't capture this item

### Step 5: Execute Updates

For new requirements:
```bash
aida add --title "..." --description "..." --type functional --status completed
```

For existing requirements:
```bash
aida comment add <SPEC-ID> "Session note: ..."
aida edit <SPEC-ID> --status completed
```

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Search for existing requirements
aida list --search "<keyword>"

# Add new requirement
aida add --title "..." --description "..." --status <status>

# Update requirement
aida edit <SPEC-ID> --status <status>

# Add comment
aida comment add <SPEC-ID> "Comment text"
```

## Best Practices

- Use status `completed` for work that was already implemented
- Use status `draft` for ideas that need refinement
- Link related requirements that were discovered during the session
- Add implementation comments with file paths that were modified
