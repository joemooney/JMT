# Capture Session Requirements

Review conversation and capture any missed requirements.

## Instructions

Follow the workflow in `.claude/skills/aida-capture.md`:

1. Scan the conversation for discussed features, bugs, or ideas
2. Identify any implemented work not yet in requirements database
3. For each finding, offer to:
   - Add as new requirement with `aida add`
   - Update existing requirement status
   - Link related requirements
4. Summarize what was captured

Use at end of conversational sessions as a safety net.
