# AIDA Sync

Sync AIDA templates and scaffolding across projects.

## Usage

```
/aida-sync
```

## Instructions

Follow the workflow in `.claude/skills/aida-sync.md`:

1. Detect if we're in the AIDA source repo or a scaffolded project
2. For AIDA repo: Check template integrity and propagation needs
3. For other projects: Check scaffold status and offer updates
4. Ensure templates, CLAUDE.md, and skills are consistent
